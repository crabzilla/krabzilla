Status: *WORK IN PROGRESS*

== Goal for version 1.0.0

To help you write your domain model with very little framework overhead and smoothly deploy it on a state of art Java 8
reactive applications platform backed by a rock solid relational database of your choice.

== Approach

The approach is to use functions everywhere within your domain implementation. For example, for an Aggregate,
we will need to implement this set of functions:

[source,kotlin]
.domain.kt
----
include::./krabzilla-core/src/main/java/crabzilla/domain.kt[tags=factory,indent=0]
----

[.lead]
So far Krabzilla has only an Aggregate example. Inspired by http://eventstorming.com/[Eventstorming], the goal is to
add examples and implementations for an ExternalSystem, a Listener and a ProcessManager / Saga.

== Modules

Krabzilla has 2 modules:

 krabzilla             → Project root
  └ krabzilla-core     → The core abstractions: Command, DomainEvent, Aggregate, Snapshot, etc
  └ krabzilla-vertx    → The application engine: runs your domain model

and your typical *example1* bounded context project will have this structure:

 example1             → Project root
  └ example1-core     → Your domain code. Services as interfaces. Almost zero dependencies.
  └ example1-database → Flyway db w/ both read and write models. Repositories implementations.
  └ example1-service  → The application: wiring, configuration and services implementations.

Load, integration and acceptance tests are against the service module.

The dependencies between the modules:

== Side Effects persistence

Krabzilla will observe the results from these functions and will persist these results:

* EntityUnitOfWork
* UnitOfWork
* Reactions
* Scheduled commands
